# GUI Application Requirements for HeartMuLa
# Python 3.10 REQUIRED

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: PyTorch MUST be installed BEFORE running pip install -e .
# The setup_gui.bat script handles this automatically in the correct order:
# 1. Install PyTorch with CUDA from: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# 2. Install Triton
# 3. Install HeartMuLa (pip install -e .)
# 4. Install these GUI requirements
#
# Manual installation if needed:
# python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
